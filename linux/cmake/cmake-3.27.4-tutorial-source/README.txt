This directory contains source code examples for the CMake Tutorial.
Each step has its own subdirectory containing code that may be used as a
starting point. The tutorial examples are progressive so that each step
provides the complete solution for the previous step.

To configure CMAKE for installation at custom path use below command line
`$ cmake --install-prefix=/home/naseeb/oneVPL/prefix_install/installable/media-driver-install/ ../`

```
    var specificLanguage_code = 
    {
        "data": {
            "lookedUpPlatform": 1,
            "query": "Kasabian+Test+Transmission",
            "lookedUpItem": {
                "name": "Test Transmission",
                "artist": "Kasabian",
                "album": "Kasabian",
                "picture": null,
                "link": "http://open.spotify.com/track/5jhJur5n4fasblLSCOcrTp"
            }
        }
    }
