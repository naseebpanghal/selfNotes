1. 
int&& var1 = 5;

 Here,
 - "var1" itself is a l-value, as its address can be taken or in other words, var1 is mapped with a memory location where it will hold some value(which is 5 in our example).
 - "Type of" var1 is r-value reference, var1 is NOT r-value reference.
 - literal "5" is a r-value.


* Interpret l-value as a "name" given to a memory address/location.
