--------------------------------------
Git has three main states that your files can reside in: committed, modified, and staged.
1. when we modify a file in our working directory, it is modified state.
2. Now this modified file is moved to staged state using; git add <filename> command.
3. Moved all staged files to Commited state using; git commit -m "why you changed the file". This command commit changes into your local database. You can move your changes to remote repo using; git push origin master;
